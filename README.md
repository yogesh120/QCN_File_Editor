QCN File Editor - Streamline Your QCN File Management!
Hey everyone,

I'm excited to share a simple QCN File Editor application I've put together. This tool aims to make working with QCN files a little easier, especially for those involved in mobile device customization or repair.

What is it?

The QCN File Editor is a desktop application built with Tkinter that provides a basic interface for:

Selecting and opening QCN files.

Viewing extracted IMEI information (IMEI 1 & IMEI 2).

Entering/modifying IMEI numbers.

Selecting Single or Dual SIM type.

Creating new QCN files based on modifications.

Key Features:

Simple GUI: A straightforward graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter.

IMEI Extraction: Extracts and displays IMEI numbers from a selected QCN file.

IMEI Modification: Allows you to input and modify IMEI numbers.

SIM Type Selection: Choose between Single SIM and Dual SIM configurations.

QCN File Creation: Creates a new QCN file with the applied changes.

Error Handling: Includes basic error messages to guide the user.

How to Use:

Dependencies: Make sure you have Python installed, along with the tkinter library (usually included by default).

Run the Script: Execute the Python script (.py file).

Select QCN File: Click the "Select QCN File" button to browse for and open a QCN file.

View IMEI: Click the "View IMEI" button to extract and display the IMEI numbers.

Modify IMEI (Optional): Enter new IMEI numbers in the provided fields.

Select SIM Type: Choose either "Single SIM" or "Dual SIM".

Create QCN File: Click the "Create QCN File" button to save a new QCN file with your changes.

Limitations:

Basic Functionality: This is a relatively simple editor and might not support all QCN file formats or advanced features.

Pattern Recognition: The IMEI extraction relies on specific byte patterns within the QCN file. These patterns may need adjustment depending on the QCN file's structure.

Error Handling: Error handling is basic and could be improved.

No Icon: Lacks proper Icon.

Disclaimer:

Modifying QCN files and IMEI numbers can potentially damage your device. Use this tool at your own risk.

Be aware of and comply with all applicable laws regarding IMEI modification in your region.

Future Improvements:

Improved error handling and validation.

More robust support for different QCN file formats.

A more advanced GUI.

Adding error with file are not correct.

Adding proper Icon

Happy editing!

This post is designed to be informative and engaging while remaining relatively high-level and accessible. It focuses on the features and usage of the tool rather than diving into the complexities of the code itself. Remember to replace the placeholder file name with the correct one. Also I have hide my way how to creating tools.
